description: Quick chat-only review of the current Git feature branch diff — no report file, no CodeTour, no commands beyond git. Use when the user says "quick review", "fast review", "sanity check my changes", "review this before I commit", or wants a short pass mid-work. For the full review with a written report, a change summary and a tour, use code-review-pr instead.

# Code Review PR — fast

A short pass over the branch diff. Chat output only. Nothing is written to
disk and no tool other than `git` runs.

Use `code-review-pr` instead when the change is going into a PR, when the
user wants to understand the change, or when infrastructure and CI/CD are
involved.

## Load the method

Read `references/review-method.md` from the installed `code-review-pr`
skill — `~/.claude/skills/code-review-pr/references/review-method.md`, or the
`~/.copilot/skills/` equivalent. If it is not there, use the condensed tables
at the bottom of this file.

Load at most one technology lens from that skill's `references/`, and only
when the diff is dominated by one stack. When the diff spans several, load
none and rely on the method plus `cross-cutting.md`.

## Run

1. **Base** — `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, else the first of
   `origin/main`, `origin/master`, `origin/develop`. Nothing resolves: ask
   once.
2. **Diff** — `git diff --stat <base>...HEAD`, then
   `git diff -U10 <base>...HEAD`. Three-dot always; two-dot pulls in
   unrelated merged work.
3. **Read** the whole file for any hunk whose surrounding context matters.
4. **Review** the changed hunks. Diff-local only — no caller search, no
   system pass. Say so at the end, so the user knows what was not checked.
5. **Report** in chat.

Skip entirely: uncommitted work, generated and vendored paths, renames with
unchanged content.

## Output

Six lines of header and findings, nothing else:

```
<branch> vs <base> · <n> files · +<a>/-<b> · lens: <one or none>
Verdict: <approve | approve with nits | changes requested | blocked>

🔴 `path:line` · Confirmed — <defect>. Fails when: <scenario>. Fix: <change>.
🟠 `path:line` · Probable — <defect>. Fails when: <scenario>. Fix: <change>.

Diff-local pass only — callers, config coupling and tests were not checked.
Run code-review-pr for the full review.
```

Clean diff: say "Nothing to flag" and stop. Never invent findings, never pad
with Nits, cap at five findings and name the overflow count.

## Condensed tables (fallback only)

Use these when `review-method.md` cannot be found.

**Severity** — 🔴 Blocker: breaks at runtime or deploy, loses data, exposes a
secret. 🟠 Major: real defect on a plausible failure path. 🟡 Minor:
correctness-neutral but costly later. 🔵 Nit: style, only when no linter
covers it, max 3.

**Confidence** — Confirmed: proven from code read here. Probable: one named
unverified assumption. Speculative: needs facts outside the repo — becomes a
question, never a finding.

**Gates** — nothing below Probable is reported; a Blocker must be Confirmed;
every Major or Blocker states concrete inputs leading to a concrete wrong
outcome, or it is dropped.

**Never report** — anything a configured linter enforces, renames, library
suggestions, idiom swaps, unmeasured performance claims, pre-existing
defects, anything not tied to a changed line.
